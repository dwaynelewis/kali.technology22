A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/lmenus/pen/eZOYXo.

 ### About
SelfType.js is a JavaScript library that animates text similarly to the style that can be found on many websites, including the Slack's or Google Docs's homepage. You can toggle some of the settings directly in this interactive demo. This project is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/lmenus/selftype).

### What's New

**v1.1**
- changed the Magic Variables syntax, so now if we were to turn off the JavaScript, the printed text would be just unstyled, as opposed to including a huge mess of variables

**v1.0**
- initial release
